    <p>
      American mathematician and aerospace engineer who in 1958 became the first
      African American female engineer to work at NASA. Although she passed away
      in 2005, the NASA headquarters have recently been named after her. She is
      often known as the 'Hidden figure' in American Aerospace history who made
      many things possible.
